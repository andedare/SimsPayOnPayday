# Todo

1. Better handling of swapping between households. For some reason, the alarm is lost to ether on household switching.
2. Support arbitrary day|time payouts
3. Payout all stored payments instead of just active.
    * Don't balk on sim id gone
4. Support seasons multiple weeks (payout at end of season instead of end of week)
